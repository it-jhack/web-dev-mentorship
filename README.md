# Web Development 1:1 Mentorship
Differently from a college or university program that builds a theoretical knowledge foundation, this mentorship program adopts a pragmatic, project-based approach. It aims to jumpstart web development skills to a level where the student can secure an internship. This project is inspired by the project-based learning methodology taught at [42 Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)).
